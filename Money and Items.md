## Money and Items
In Tabula, money is very abstract so as to avoid tedium and allow each setting to have it's own currency. Items will be listed in the setting store with a price of **free**, **cheap**, **expensive** or **unobtainable**. **Cheap** and **expensive** items can be bought with minor and major purchases, respectively. Abstractly, these can be obtained by converting character points and boons into minor and major purchases, again respectively. To see what each purchase represents in game you will have to refer to your settings "currency" section. Both money and everything money can buy are flavor.

> This is the store from Sequoia, the example setting.

### Acquisition
Character points and boons can be converted to purchases. This conversion is permanent. One CP can be converted to one minor purchase. One boon can be converted to one major purchase. This can be done at character creation or at the beginning of downtime.

### Refresh
Some of you may be concerned that if you convert boons and CP to items and then  lose them your character will be weaker forever. Fear not! Purchases refresh at the beginning of downtime. This means that while you won't have your item you will be able to purchase a replacement. At the beginning of downtime if you have fewer cheap items than your total of CP converted to minor purchases, you get minor purchases equal to the difference. Similarly, if you have fewer expensive items than your total of boons converted to major purchases, you get major purchases equal to the difference.

### Purchases
Items are flavor and should be represented on the character sheet in the flavor section. Keep track of whether each item was **free**, **cheap** or **expensive** such that you can refresh the item at downtime if it becomes lost. Additionally, track the total number of CP converted to minor purchases and boons converted to major purchases.

### Selling
Items can be sold! If you want your purchase back, simply find a character in the story who wants it. If you sell a cheap or expensive your immediately get your purchase back and can spend it on something else.

### Crafting
Crafting can be used to make items. This is useful because you can get custom items, items that are otherwise unobtainable, items that have never existed, or just whatever you need at the moment. To start, purchase materials of the same quality as the item you want to end up with. Next, as usual, propose an item to your storyteller. If they accept, describe how you make it and make a roll. If you succeed, you get your items. If you don't, the materials are lost.

### Lending
If you let another players character borrow your item, it still counts as your item and affects your total item counts and not theirs. You cannot break this system by giving all of your items to other characters because your purchases won't refresh.
