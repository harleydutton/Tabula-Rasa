# Items
Items are a type of flavor. 

# Money
* refactor purchase types 
  * free
  * cheap
  * expensive
  * priceless/unobtainable
* track purchase type for each item (put +, *, or - next to each)
* lost purchases refresh at the beginning of downtime (Ethan thinks this should be heavily emphasized and in it's own section which I will name Refresh. I'm unsure if I agree...)
## Lost
* Item left possession unwillingly
* purchases spent on failed crafting attempts
* used consumable items
* stolen, broken, or permanently unavailable for some other reason.
## Selling
* Item leaves possession immediately and compensation is received in barter or equivalent purchase
* if items are sold their purchases immediately refresh
* you still have to find a buyer who wants your stuff and can pay something you find acceptable.
## Charity
* Item left possession willingly
* No compensation or expectation of compensation
* Does not count as lost or sold
* Purchases do not refresh ever
* lending items to party members counts
## Crafting
* can potentially craft things that cannot be bought
* conversation with storyteller to attempt
* purchases spent on materials that are lost during crafting refresh at the start of downtime
* successful crafts don't refresh until the craft is lost or sold or deconstructed
## Loot
* Looted items don't really use this system
